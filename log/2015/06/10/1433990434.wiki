A long time friend, **Robert Reppel**, introduced me to **Joel Skrepnek**, Joel quickly follows-up.

― Hi Charles, 
―  
― I am exploring new opportunities and Koho looks really interesting to me. 
―  
― Would you be up for a chat on the phone, or to meet for a drink to see if there's something to it? 
―  
― Cheers, 
―  
― Joel
