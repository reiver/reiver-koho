A long time friend, **Robert Reppel**, introduced me to **Joel Skrepnek**.

― Hi Charles, 
―  
― ... not acting in my best interest here because I really wouldn't like to lose one of our really good, really senior guys but alas - Joel has asked if I could introduce him to you. He's interested in what Koho are doing, so here goes. :) 
―  
― Joel, meet Charles. Charles, meet Joel. If anything comes off this you owe me a beer. Both of you. In case of Charles, two beers. At least. 
―  
― Cheers, 
―  
― Robert
