He said this was the first time anyone ever took a photo of him.

(The Financial Post is going to write an article about Koho.
The **Financial Post** photographer came over to take photos me (**Charles Iliya Krempeaux**), **Danei Eberhard**, **Scott Bell**, **Amy Soetopo**, and **Beijun Luo**.)

The room behind the **Financial Post** photographer is the //first Koho office// — or more accurately, a single desk in that room is the //first Koho office/.
We aren't in there anymore.
The current Koho office — the //second Koho office// — is off-camera, to the left (from the point of view of that photo).
