The day before I was introduced (over LinkedIn) to (the CEO of Koho) Daniel Eberhard by my friend Anthony Tsui.

(Anthony and I have been friends for a number of years, and had met through the tech conferences and tech meetups in Vancouver.)

Daniel responded with this message (over LinkedIn):

― Thanks for the intro Anthony. 
― 
― Pleasure connecting Charles. 
― Can you shoot me an email at daniel@koho.ca and we can discuss this further. 
― 
― In the mean time, you can check out Koho.ca, watch the video, see the team/advisory page. 
― 
― Thanks very much,
