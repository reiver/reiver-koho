I was introduced to (the CEO of Koho) Daniel Eberhard by my friend Anthony Tsui.

(Anthony and I have been friends for a number of years, and had met through the tech conferences and tech meetups in Vancouver.)

Anthony sent Daniel this message (over LinkedIn):

― Hi Daniel, 
― 
― Please meet Charles, I understand that Koho may be looking for a CTO and I think you guys should talk. 
― 
― Charles has lots of startup tech experience - as a lead engineer at Hootsuite in its early days, and engineering manager at Trulioo when it got started. 
― 
― He was a Principal Software Engineer at EA applying some hard core machine learning and data science to marketing up until a few months ago. 
― 
― He's been doing customer discovery and research on his own startup idea for the past few months. 
― Though he didn't get the validation he needed so he's looking to join another company. 
― 
― Cheers, 
― Anthony
