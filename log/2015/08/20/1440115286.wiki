**Joel Skrepnek** had recently joined Koho.
And pretty quickly he started working on the Koho mobile app (while I created back-end, and **Scott Bell** design the user-experience and user-interface).

We took a photo of the mobile app on an actual mobile phone (rather than running in a web browser) and sent it to **Daniel Eberhard** (who had been away from the office).
