We were sitting in the //revenue room// at //Launch Academy//.

It was me (**Charles Iliya Krempeaux**), **Daniel Eberhard**, and **Scott Bell** sitting in the room — which at the time //was Koho// — i.e., Koho's founding team.

We put Google Analytics on the big screen TV that was in the room.

We sat there waiting to see the first person sign-up for Koho — to get on the Koho waiting list.

The photograph is of the first Koho (waiting-list) sign-up 🙂
