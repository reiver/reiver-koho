This is the story of the purchase ever made on a Koho card.

❦

**Amy Soetopo**, who was a //software engineer// at //Stanley Park Ventures// (SPV) and did the original front-end software engineering work for Koho, was leaving SPV going to Spain.

She was having a //going away// party this day.

Before we all (at Koho) went to her party, **Daniel Eberhard** checked the mailbox.

We had been expecting the Visa //white-cards// to arrive for the last couple weeks, but it just happened that they were in the mailbox this time when we checked.

("//White-cards//" are real working //Visa cards// meant for testing purposes, with no decorations or anything else.
Just a white plastic card with a magnetic strip and CVV on the back, and the card number and expiry date on the front.
Nothing else — no names, no logos, nothing.)

As the last of us left the party, **Joel Skrepnek** looked at me and said something like, “//we could load the card//”.

To which I responded with something like, “//we __should__ load the card//”.

We went to the Koho office, where Joel logged into the Galileo Processing //administrative system// and put $200 on the //white card//.

(Galileo Processing is a Visa card //payment processor//.
And like all //payment processors//, they connect Visa to the bank account.)

It was late at this time of the evening, and there wasn't much open.

We (i.e., **Joel Skrepnek** and I (**Charles Iliya Krempeaux**)) walked around a bit, and decided to go into the Starbucks on Water Street, in downtown Vancouver.

I convinced the girl working at the Starbucks counter to let me use the white-card, and I bought 2 lemonloafs.
(One for myself and one for Joel.)

I think I told her something like:

― I am from the bank, and I need to test the credit card payment system.

**The first Koho transaction happened this day.** 🙂
