The first //real// Koho cards arrived!

Not the //white-card// — i.e., not the //blank// Visa card used for testing.
But a //real// Koho card — with the Koho logo, our name, etc.

We had to make compromises for this card.

If we would have chosen to wait for the //perfect// card — then we would have had to wait a long time.
Months more (waiting) — maybe even more than 1 year.

We had a number of delays with our partners — and going with this simple card was the best option we had available, to get to market //sooner// rather than //later//.

But regardless, things are feeling a lot more real now.
And this is a big step for Koho!

But, I want a //black colored// Koho card later 🙂
