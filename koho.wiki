Koho is a Canadian fintech company that provides banking services.
Legally it isn't a bank yet (as legally that requires a license).
But it provides what normal people consider //banking//.

I was Koho's founding CTO.
From ((Thursday May 7th, 2015)) to ((Friday January 12th, 2018)) I worked on Koho.

This is the **Koho story** from my point of view.
