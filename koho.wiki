§ Koho

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**Koho** is a Canadian fintech company that provides banking services.
Legally it isn't a bank yet (as legally that requires a license).
But it provides what normal people consider //banking// services.

I was Koho's founding CTO.
From ((Thursday May 7th, 2015)) to ((Friday January 12th, 2018)) I worked on Koho;
although really this story starts on ((Wednesday April 1st, 2015)) when I first got involved with Koho.

This is the **Koho story** from my point of view.
