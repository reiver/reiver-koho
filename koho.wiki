§ Koho

⸺ by Charles Iliya Krempeaux

**Koho Financial** is a Canadian fintech company that provides banking services.
Legally it isn't a bank yet (as legally that requires a license).
But it provides what //normal people// consider //banking// services.

I (**Charles Iliya Krempeaux**) was the founding //chief technology officer// (CTO) of **Koho Financial**.

From //Thursday May 7th, 2015// to //Friday January 12th, 2018// I worked on Koho;
although really this //Koho story// starts on //Wednesday April 1st, 2015// when I first got involved with Koho.

The founding team of **Koho** was myself (**Charles Iliya Krempeaux**), **Daniel Eberhard**, **Scott Bell**; with **Amy Soetopo** doing part-time work on Koho.
Later **Joel Skrepnek** was hired, and joined the **Koho** team.
And after that **Jaclyn Quinn** joined the **Koho** team.

That was Koho at its genesis — when we figured out how to build a //bank// — and built it.

This is the **Koho story** from my point of view.
